Hana archticture:
Name server : The name server, which runs in the system database, owns the information about the topology of the SAP HANA system, 
              including knowledge of the tenant databases that exist in the system.
Index server : The index server, which runs in every tenant database, contains the actual data stores and the engines for processing the data.
                Index Server processes incoming SQL or MDX statement.

HDB Deployment Infrastructure Server    : HDI handles the deployment of design-time artifacts into the SAP HANA database.

XS classic server : The XS classic server can run as a separate server process or embedded within the index server.
 diserver           SAP HANA database and allows developers to write and run SAP HANA-based applications without the need to run an additional application server. 
                     SAP HANA XS is also used to run web-based tools that come with SAP HANA, for instance for administration, lifecycle management and development.


esserver : Hana dynamic tier -uasge of warm data

dpserver : data provisiong server -- data provisioning server is part of the SAP HANA smart data integration option for SAP HANA.
            It provides capabilities such as data provisioning in real time and batch mode, real-time data transformations,


Preprocessor server : The preprocessor server is used by the index server to analyze text data and extract the information on which the text search capabilities are based. It runs in the system database and serves all tenant databases.

Compile server : The compile server performs the compilation of stored procedures and programs, for example, SQLScript procedures. It runs on every host and does not persist data. It runs in the system database and serves all tenant databases.

Script server: The script server is used to execute application function libraries written in C++. The script server is optional and must be started manually in the database that requires it.

SAP Web Dispatcher : The Web Dispatcher processes inbound HTTP and HTTPS connections to XS classic services.

SAP start service : The SAP start service is responsible for starting and stopping the other services in the correct order. It also performs other functions, such as monitoring their runtime state.

xscontroller : The Controller is the central management component of SAP HANA XS advanced
               it has a view on all deployed and/or running applications, and persists configuration and status information in the database.


xsexecagent:  The Execution Agent is responsible for managing processes, that is starting, keeping alive, and stopping tasks.

hdixsuaaserver : The UAA service manages user logon and logoff requests in SAP HANA XS advanced.

demon service: The daemon service is the process responsible for starting all HANA core process.

SAP HANA persists in-memory data by using savepoints. Each SAP HANA service has its own separate savepoints. 
During a savepoint operation, the SAP HANA database flushes all changed data from memory to the data volumes. 
The data belonging to a savepoint represents a consistent state of the data on disk and remains so until the next savepoint operation has completed. 
Redo log entries are written to the log volumes for all changes to persistent data. In the event of a database restart (for example, after a crash), 
the data from the last completed savepoint can be read from the data volumes, and the redo log entries written to the log volumes since the last savepoint 
can be replayed.


Service	Note
nameserver	Only the nameserver service in the system database on the active master host persists data. Slave namesever hosts communicate with the master, but do not persist data.
indexserver	The indexserver service in tenant databases on all hosts except standby hosts persists data. This data volume can be partitioned to improve performance when reading and writing to this server.
xsengine (if running as a separate service)	The xsengine service persists data on any host on which it is running.

used memory:
The total amount of memory used by SAP HANA is referred to as used memory. 
It includes program code and stack, all data and system tables, and the memory required for temporary computations.

Peak Used Memory:
SAP HANA has a special used memory indicator called peak used memory. As the value for used memory is a current measurement, 
peak used memory allows you to track the maximum value for used memory over time.

Resident Memory:
Resident memory is the real physical memory that processes utilize in the current state. 
The resident physical memory is a pool of memory used, representing the SAP HANA, operating system, and other programs	.

Total Resident is the total size of resident memory in the operating system, including other programs;

Complete backup: A full backup is a type of data backup that involves copying all data in the SAP HANA database to a backup location. 
                 This includes both the data and log volumes, as well as the configuration and system files.



Delta backup : Delta backups in SAP HANA contain only the data that has been modified since the previous full data backup or the most recent delta backup.

               Differential backup : A differential backup includes the data that has been modified since the previous full data backup.
               Incremental backup : An incremental backup contains the data modified since the previous full data backup or the most recent delta backup.

log backup: A log backup is a backup of the transaction log, which contains all the changes made to the database since the last backup. 
This type of backup ensures that all transactions are captured in the backup and can be used for point-in-time recovery.

XSA restart

Let's start by checking whether the XS Engine is running on your SAP HANA instance.
Open up a browser and point it to the address http://<server>:80<instance>

How to restart manually services?
During initial analysis, administrator can try restarting nameserver and indexserver manually by executing ./hdbnameserver and ./hdbindexserver 
from exe directory in the sequence to see if these are starting successfully.
